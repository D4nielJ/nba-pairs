# NBAPairs

> This project searches through NBA players heights based on user input.

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This application takes a single integer to input. The application will download the raw data from the website `https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights` and print a list of all pairs of players whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application.

The data is served in json format by the endpoint `https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/`
